# Forensics
## Challenge 2
We are given a ``eerie-area.pcapng`` file for this challenge. The first thing that I always do is to filter and analyze important protocols first like HTTP or DNS.

Looking at HTTP packets, notice a strange GET request where the full URL seems to be ``http://www.example.com/4W3i2hyrJTVfRrM77fBXcpRjYJwb3NkzyzP3kAXWqy9N2sJKm6Y``. However, accessing it gives a random domain.

So I tried decoding the URL with base58 and we get another URL that redirects to dropmefiles.

Entering the website, we can download another file which gives us an executable file (``dropmefiles.net_boo.exe``). Using 7zip we can discover hidden stuff in this .exe file and after going through all of them, we come across a flag.

However, this was a bait!! So I just check the contents in this .exe file and found the real flag.
