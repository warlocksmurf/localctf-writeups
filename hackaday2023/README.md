Sadly I could not retrieve the old files, but basically I cleared 1 OSINT challenge where I had to use WayBackMachine to check an ex-employee's name and 2 Threat Hunting challenges where I had to analyze an image of a compromised machine. One of the threats were located in the Desktop while the other was in the Preference directory.
