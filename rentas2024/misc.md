# Task 1: Hidden Discord
Question: Starting point: (https://discord[.]gg/7aMtftbDY4)

Flag: `RWSC{r34d_d15c0rd_d3v3l0p3r_API_r3f3r3nc3}`

We are given a link to join a Discord server. Inside the server, the admin mentioned that there are 5 parts of the flag throughout the server.

Part 1 of the flag was easily noticed, its in the chat room of the voice channel. Similarly, part 3 can be easily found in the events tab.

While getting the flag parts we actually got several hints from the admin. 

```
Find the CATegory? :black_cat: :cat2:

For part 2 and 4, my teammate @Shen helped find them with special plugins. After finding this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7YFN-nT3Q) about [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/), he managed to get part 2 and 4 of the flag.
